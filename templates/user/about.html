        <i><b>About Rate My Sci-Fi </b></i> <br />
        Search the web for movie ratings and you will quickly find 
        several websites to choose from, with 1000s of reviews and 
        ratings for a plethora of movies.â€‹ However, with so many options to choose from
        it can be difficult for fans of certain genres to interact. This is how
        Rate My Sci-Fi was born! This is a space where all Sci-Fi fans can add movies to the database,
        rate and review movies, add movies to your favourites list, and discuss
        with fellow Sci-Fi enthusiasts. Feel free to celebrate your favourites,
        diss your least-liked, or simply enjoy the company of others who share your love for Sci-Fi. <br />
